<h2>I'm Sue and I am a trained professional organizer, certified by the POC and I can help YOU get your life back</h2> 

<p>
    How hard is it to get organized, you ask? Why does someone even need the help of a professional.  Those are questions, I am sure a lot of people ask themselves before they tackle the job of trying to get organized.  

Do you constantly look for items every day? Do you feel stressed in your surroundings because of clutter?  Do you envision what your life would be like, if only you could get everything in order.   You decided that you will start tomorrow.   “You may delay,but time will not, and lost time is never found again”  Benjamin Franklin
Organizing is ongoing.  It takes time to get a house or office organized.  Once it is done, then it takes little effort to keep it that way.  It's the starting process that’s hard to get going.  We see lots of pictures in magazines that show us what a beautiful space can look like, but is   someone really living there?  They seem beautiful in the  magazine, but are they functional? It has to be very functional first.  If it doesn’t work for you, then it really doesn’t matter how pretty it is, it will never last.  You need to be able to find things quickly, put things away efficiently and have the space make you happy and stress free.  When you have achieved that, then you are organized no matter what it looks like to anyone else.    
This is where an organizer can help you.  Time is a big factor.  Most people don't have the time or don't even want to start.  They would rather do fun things with their family and friends.
This is where I come in.  I can help YOU solve your issues, work with YOU to make the changes that YOU want, and help take the stress out of your surroundings.  I have many different services available, and some that aren’t even listed yet.  We can set up a plan for action, schedule time to accomplish your goals, and feel great when we have accomplished the task.   Before you know it, you will find peace and harmony in your space.
